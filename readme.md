# As The Days Go By ...

Today is **Friday, November 15th, 2019** and I decided to put up this public diary kind of thing on GitHub. The decision is largely inspired by Jacob Steinhardt's [Making Shit Work](https://makingshitwork.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/introduction/). Again, hopefully this will help other people as well, but what I've learned about myself throughout all these years is that *somehow* I end up wasting way less time if I know others are watching (though I sincerely hope this attempt won't ruin it).

For now what I have in mind is to have one folder for each year (hopefully that would be 5 folders) and one document for each month of a year. At the end of every month I will update the table of content.

The sole reason I'm using GitHub for this is me being lazy (GitHub supports Markdown and Markdown is enough so why not?).
